# How to submit a project using Git Branches

1. From the `Ada-CX` repository, create a __new branch__ using the dropdown technique covered in class in the following format:
`[b or p]/[your_initials]/master`

2. Fork the `Ada-CX` repository

3. Verify that your forked repository has the branch you created in step #1. If it does not, delete your fork and try steps #1 and #2 again.

4. Clone your fork on to your computer as you would normally.

5. __Switch to the branch you created in step #1. No code shall be committed to the `master` branch.__

4. Once you complete baseline, submit a PR from your fork to the Ada-CX repository. Switch the branch __on both the base and head__ to the branch you created in step #1.
