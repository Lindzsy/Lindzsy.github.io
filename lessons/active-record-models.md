# Active Record: Models
## Learning Goals
- Use AR _models_ to perform CRUD tasks on database records
- Joyfully embrace the _Rails Console_
- Begin exploring the AR _query interface_

## Active Record as a DSL
Given a table in our database called _students_ that has this structure:

| id | name     | pie         | birthday   |
|:--:|:--------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
|  1 | Sheena   | peach       | 08-13-1977 |
|  2 | Rosa     | apple       | 05-01-2008 |
|  3 | Raquel   | apple       | 03-27-2003 |

We should have a corresponding file called `app/models/student.rb`. It will look like this:

```ruby
class Student < ActiveRecord::Base

end
```

This is our Student _model_, and it is connected to a table in the database called _students_. We don't have to explicitly tell Rails about that connection; by following the naming conventions (thank you, Inflector!), Rails knows which database table to use with which _model_. By doing this you'll also have the ability to map the columns of each row in that table with the attributes of the instances of your model.

For right now, our _models_ will likely be empty Ruby classes. The inherited class (`ActiveRecord::Base`) provides a tremendous amount of functionality. As we move forward in the curriculum, we will begin filling out our models with additional functionality.

## Interacting with models in the _Rails console_
Rails provides a REPL (similar to irb and pry) that pre-loads all the application information when started. It's one of the most useful tools I've encountered. Let's spend some time exploring it. From your application root, run `$ bin/rails console`:

```bash
 ❤️  :: rails console
Running via Spring preloader in process 48975
Loading development environment (Rails 4.2.6)
2.3.0 :001 >
```

Now we're in the _console_, from here we can do all the stuff that irb and pry provide, plus have access to all of our Rails models. Use the console to create an __instance__ of our Student _model_:

```ruby
2.3.0 :001 > s = Student.new
 => #<Student id: nil, name: nil, pie: nil, motto: nil, created_at: nil, updated_at: nil>
2.3.0 :002 > s.attributes
 => {"id"=>nil, "name"=>nil, "pie"=>nil, "motto"=>nil, "created_at"=>nil, "updated_at"=>nil}
2.3.0 :003 >
```

We can assign data to the instance using plain Ruby:
```ruby
2.3.0 :003 > s.name = "Libby"
 => "Libby"
2.3.0 :004 > s.pie = "Apple"
 => "Apple"
2.3.0 :006 > s.attributes
 => {"id"=>nil, "name"=>"Libby", "pie"=>"Apple", "motto"=>nil, "created_at"=>nil, "updated_at"=>nil}
```

When we are happy with the data in our _model_, we can write it to the database using a single command:

```ruby
2.3.0 :007 > s.save
   (0.3ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (1.8ms)  INSERT INTO "students" ("name", "pie", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Libby"], ["pie", "Apple"], ["created_at", "2016-04-17 18:17:52.649965"], ["updated_at", "2016-04-17 18:17:52.649965"]]
   (1.5ms)  commit transaction
 => true
2.3.0 :008 >
```

__Question: ZOMG what just happened?__
The Active Record DSL translates our Ruby code into SQL, and then executes it.

```ruby
Student.where(pie: "apple").order('birthday DESC')
```
becomes

```sql
SELECT * FROM "students" WHERE "pie" = "apple"  ORDER BY birthday DESC;
```

## AR Class Methods: Finding and Organizing Records
ActiveRecord class methods are generally for locating & reading rows from the database:

```ruby
# return a collection of all rows in the students table
students = Student.all

# return the first student (lowest id)
student = Student.first

# return the first student (lowest id) named Libby
libby = Student.find_by(name: 'Libby')

# return students in a specific order
alphabetical_students = Student.order(:name)

# the AR DSL is structured to use chaining to create more specific queries
# here we find all students that prefer apply pie
# *and* return them in reverse alphabetical order
team_apple = Student.where(pie: "Apple").order(name: :desc)

# provide compound conditions to do more specific queries
rosa_and_apple = Student.where(name: "Rosa", pie: "apple")

# use `not` to exclude values from results
not_apple = Student.where.not(pie: "apple")
rosa_but_not_apple = Student.where(name: "Rosa").where.not(pie: "apple")

# we can use `find` to pull a bunch of records at once too
ids = [1,2,3]
Student.find(ids) # returns an array of Student records

# ...but I think using `where` to do this is a more semantic
Student.where(id: ids)
```

### Parameter Binding with Active Record

Active Record uses something called _parameter binding_ to take our requests and convert them into SQL, the nearly universal language of databases and (most importantly) make queries more secure (google research: [_sql injection_](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=sql%20injection)), and to improve the reusability of queries. This idea is very important in Rails, and AR provides it.

If you write code using the `where` syntax above in the rails console (like `Student.where(name: "Rosa")`), Active Record _does parameter binding automatically_. Active Record can also provides manual parameter binding:

```ruby
# using '?'
Student.where("name = ?", "Rosa")

# using named parameters
Student.where("name = :name AND pie = :pie", name: "Rosa", pie: "apple")
```

The first line above uses the `?` symbol as a placeholder, and inserts the second argument into that position.  So it is looking for students where the name is "Rosa."

The second line makes a more complicated query and has 2 named parameters, `:name` and `:pie` and passes in a hash where the named parameter values are passed in.  

So something like this would work as well:

```ruby
Student.where("name = :name OR pie = :pie", {name: "Sheena", pie: "apple"})
```

### Using AR to modify rows in the database
Instances of Active Record models can be created from a hash, a block or have their attributes manually set after creation. Once an instance has its data attributes defined, it can be saved to the database, making a persistent record of that data.

#### `new` vs. `create`
`new` returns a new object of that class, but doesn't save it to the database.

```ruby
# `new` with preset data
desi = Student.new(name: "Desi", pie: "blueberry")
desi.id # => nil
```

```ruby
# an "empty" new student
student = Student.new
# assigning data attributes
student.name = "Desi"
student.pie = "blueberry"
```

Meanwhile, `create` will initialize a new instance of the model *and* save it to the database:
```ruby
desi = Student.create(name: "Desi", pie: "blueberry")
desi.id #=> 5
```

#### Editing an existing row
Once we've located a record using `find`, `where`, or other class methods, we can modify the data in the __instances__ returned. Calling `save` on those instances will then persist the altered data back to the database.

```ruby
# find the student we want to modify
rosa = Student.where(name: "Rosa").first
rosa.pie #=> "apple"

# change Rosa's pie preference
rosa.pie = "blueberry"
rosa.pie #=> "blueberry"

# assign rosa's motto
rosa.motto = "All things in moderation, except pie."

# save rosa's data back to the database
rosa.save

(0.1ms)  begin transaction
SQL (0.3ms)  UPDATE "students" SET "pie" = ?, "motto" = ?, "updated_at" = ? WHERE "students"."id" = ?  [["pie", "blueberry"], ["motto", "All things in moderation, except pie."], ["updated_at", "2016-04-17 19:57:22.501674"], ["id", 6]]
(1.3ms)  commit transaction
# => true
```

#### Removing rows from the database
Similar to updating data, we can invoke a method on an _instance_ of an AR model to remove it's associated data from the database

```ruby
# count our students
Student.count #=> 7

# find the student we want to remove
libby = Student.find_by(name: "Libby")

# remove the record from the database
libby.destroy

(0.1ms)  begin transaction
SQL (1.5ms)  DELETE FROM "students" WHERE "students"."id" = ?  [["id", 7]]
(1.5ms)  commit transaction
 #=> <Student id: 7, name: "Libby", pie: nil, motto: nil, birthday: nil, created_at: "2016-04-17 20:04:01", updated_at: "2016-04-17 20:04:01", hobby: nil>

# count our students again
Student.count #=> 6

# now there's not a libby in the database
libby = Student.find_by(name: "Libby") #=> nil
```

**WARNING:** An AR model does also have a `delete` method and it will delete the instance from the database, but it does **[not](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22757450/difference-between-destroy-and-delete)** do exactly the same thing.  We will discuss it a bit later when we introduce relationships.  For now, just avoid using it.    

## Summary Tables
For any call that takes a hash, the argument will be of form `attribute: value` or `attribute: [list, of, possible, values]`. To check multiple attributes, add them to the hash: `name: 'libby', pie: 'apple'`. You can also pass a hash object to any of these.

Calls that talk to the DB will always result in a SQL query. Calls that are memoized will result in a SQL query the first time only (so subsequent changes to the database will not be shown).

### Retrieving Entries from the DB
These can be run on an ActiveRecord class (like `Student`) or on any collection (like the result of `Student.all`).

| Method                           | Description                        | Arguments  | Returns                | Talks to DB |
|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------|:-----------------------|:------------|
| `Student.all`                    | Get all table entries              | N/A        | Collection of Students | Yes         |
| `Student.first`, `Student.last`  | Get entry with lowest / highest ID | N/A        | One Student            | Yes         |
| `Student.find(4)`                | Get the entry in row 4             | Fixnum     | One Student            | Yes         |
| `Student.where(name: 'libby')`   | Get entries that match             | Hash       | Collection of Students | Yes         |
| `Student.find_by(name: 'libby')` | Get matching entry with lowest ID  | Hash       | One Student            | Yes         |
| `Student.order(:name)`           | Sort entries                       | Field Name | Collection of Students | Yes         |
| `Student.count`                  | Count entries                      | N/A        | Fixnum                 | Yes         |
| `Student.size`                   | Count entries                      | N/A        | Fixnum                 | Memoized    |
| `Student.empty?`                 | Are there zero entries?            | N/A        | Boolean                | Memoized    |

### Interacting with a Retrieved Entry
Assume that `libby` is a local copy of an entry in the table, as returned by a call like `Student.first`. Remember that any changes made to a local copy will not be reflected in the database until `save` is called on that copy.

| Method                | Description                                | Arguments | Returns | Talks to DB |
|:----------------------|:-------------------------------------------|:----------|:--------|:------------|
| `libby.attributes`    | Get a hash containing all fields           | N/A       | Hash    | No          |
| `libby.name`          | Get the value of one field                 | N/A       | Value   | No          |
| `libby.id`            | Get the unique ID assigned by ActiveRecord | N/A       | Value   | No          |
| `libby.pie = 'peach'` | Modify the value of one field              | Value     | Value   | No          |

### Modifying the DB
`save`, `create`, `update`, and `destroy` are the only ways to change what's stored in the database - other methods just change local copies of the data. To use the vocabulary we learned for HTTP verbs, these methods are _unsafe_.

| Method                                        | Description                                    | Arguments | Returns     | Talks to DB |
|:----------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| `libby = Student.new`                         | Make a new entry, stored in a local variable   | Hash      | One Student | No          |
| `libby.save`                                  | Save a local copy of an entry to the DB        | N/A       | Boolean     | Yes         |
| `Student.create(name: 'libby', pie: 'peach')` | Make a new a entry and save to the DB          | Hash      | One Student | Yes         |
| `libby.update(pie: apple)`                    | Modify an entry and save to the DB             | Hash      | One Student | Yes         |
| `libby.destroy`                               | Remove an entry from the DB, freeze local copy | N/A       | One Student | Yes         |
