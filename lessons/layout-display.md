# Layout: Display


## Learning Goals ðŸ“š
- Identify the differences between each display type

## Display Property
The display property has a long list of potential values. There are three values we are going to focus on while we learn about layout: inline, inline-block & block.

- Inline elements:
  - respect left & right margins and padding, but **not** top & bottom
  - **cannot** have a width and height set
  - allow other elements to sit to their left and right

- Block elements:
  - respect all of the margins and padding
  - force a line break after the block element

- Inline-block elements:
  - respect top & bottom margins and padding
  - respect height and width
  - allow other elements to sit to their left and right

## Modifying an element's default styles

To have elements with default block displays to be inline with each other, it's `display` property and `width` need to be modified.

Use this [Codepen](http://codepen.io/jamazing/pen/rrxLZo) example to experiment with the element's display values.
