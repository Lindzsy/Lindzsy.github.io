# Creating an Inclusive Culture

## Learning Goals
+ Introduce allyship and intersectionality
+ Devise ways to be more inclusive inside and outside of Ada

## Discussion
+ Open Discussion
  +	The goal of these discussion and this arm of Ada to equipped you with the knowledge to be a more conscious and open-minded software developers.  We are concentrating on making an impact on your tiny classroom of 24, so you can later go out and make an impact on this industry as a whole.  I say this all the time, women don’t leave this industry because of the work, they leave because the environment, and we aren’t just changing the industry in numbers, we care changing what this industry is as a whole.
+ What did you think of the reading
+ Why is allyship in the context of Ada and women in software development important and this classroom?
  + What we don’t want to be is a program just for one type of women.  White women, who society has afforded the exposure, the history, and the societal privilege to be successful at Ada. To be completely honest Ada in the pass has suffered some mis-steps here.  We have said we are inclusive and called ourselves allys, without walking the walk.  This is us walking the walk.  
Saying we are more inclusive in the classroom is one thing.  This is us doing.
Black lives matter vs all lives matter
+ Have any of you heard concept of intersectionality? Kimberle Crenshaw.  “is the study of overlapping or intersecting social identities and related systems of oppression, domination, or discrimination.
+	My intersections on the board- Women. Black. Hetero. Middle-class.
+	What are some of yours?
+ 	What sort of injustice or inequality is Ada trying to ratify in the tech world of Seattle?  
	We at Ada are very successful with making a real disruption  at Ada

+ Why is it important for us to talk about intersectionality?
+   Building allyship around these other identities that are still oppressed and not addressed.  

+ What are some concrete actions that we can execute on the personal level to make Ada more hospitable for all?
+ What are some concrete actions that we can execute on the Ada-Organization level to make Ada more hospitable for all?
+ How do we address intersectionality beyond the Ada community? What does it mean to the Tech Industry? The World?
