# An Introduction to Ruby Gems
Gems are what other languages call a library. They are packaged code that can be shared and distributed. Most gems are distributed using [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/). A Gem will contain one or more
Ruby Classes, just like the ones you've been creating this week. Let's look at a couple gems to get an idea of what would be packaged and why:

- [Rails](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails)
- [Sinatra](https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra)
- [Colorize](https://rubygems.org/gems/colorize)

## Installing Gems
Installing gems is super easy! We do it right from the Terminal. To install the gem `Money`, do `$ gem install money`. You can see all the gems currently installed using `$ gem list`.

## Requiring Gems
Since gems are external Ruby libraries, they are not included in core Ruby. To use the code provided by the gem, we `require` it in our code base. This can be done at the top of any Ruby script, file, or in `irb`:

```ruby
require "money"
```

### Example: Using the `money` gem.
Generally the github page for a gem is the best place to go to get started. Let's check out the [money gems page](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money). Under _usage_ we see some common examples of how to use this gem.

```ruby
require 'money'

# 10.00 USD
money = Money.new(1000, "USD")
money.cents     #=> 1000
money.currency  #=> Currency.new("USD")

# Comparisons
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(1000, "USD")   #=> true
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(100, "USD")    #=> false
Money.new(1000, "USD") == Money.new(1000, "EUR")   #=> false
Money.new(1000, "USD") != Money.new(1000, "EUR")   #=> true

# Arithmetic
Money.new(1000, "USD") + Money.new(500, "USD") == Money.new(1500, "USD")
Money.new(1000, "USD") - Money.new(200, "USD") == Money.new(800, "USD")
Money.new(1000, "USD") / 5                     == Money.new(200, "USD")
Money.new(1000, "USD") * 5                     == Money.new(5000, "USD")

# Currency conversions
Money.add_rate("USD", "CAD", 1.24515)
Money.add_rate("CAD", "USD", 0.803115)
puts Money.new(1000, "USD").exchange_to("CAD").format
```

### Example: Using Colorize
Next let's take a quick look at the colorize gem

```bash
gem install colorize
```

Look at the [usage section](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize) of the github page

```ruby
puts "This is blue".colorize(:blue)
puts "This is light blue".colorize(:light_blue)
puts "This is also blue".colorize(:color => :blue)
puts "This is light blue with red background".colorize(:color => :light_blue, :background => :red)
puts "This is light blue with red background".colorize(:light_blue ).colorize( :background => :red)
puts "This is blue text on red".blue.on_red
puts "This is red on blue".colorize(:red).on_blue
puts "This is red on blue and underline".colorize(:red).on_blue.underline
puts "This is blue text on red".blue.on_red.blink
puts "This is uncolorized".blue.on_red.uncolorize
```
