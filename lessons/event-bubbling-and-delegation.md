## Learning Goals

* Understand event bubbling
* Learn to use event bubbling to set event listeners

## Event Basics

Events are happening all the time in the browser. When the browser has finished loading the page, an event is fired. Every time the user moves their mouse, hovers over an element, clicks or taps, submits a form, presses down on a key or takes their finger off that key — an event is fired. Some of these events are very easy to spot when they occur (e.g. the user clicks on a hyperlink), but many go by completely unnoticed.

It is, however, possible for us to use JavaScript to set up listeners for events that interest us. Our listeners wait patiently on a DOM node until the event they're waiting for is fired. Then, they spring into action, running an appropriate function to respond to the event as required, or whatever else you deem appropriate.

For a review of how to set event listeners, please refer to the [DOM Manipulation with JavaScript Lesson](http://frontend.turing.io/lessons/dom-manipulation-with-javascript.html)

## Event Bubbling

Now we've talked about the very basics of events, let's turn our attention to event bubbling, which refers to the ability of events set on DOM nodes to "bubble up" and also apply to children of those nodes. We'll start with a quick experiment.

### Experiment

In the following code pen, we have three nested HTML elements in `index.html`:

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="23788" data-slug-hash="ZOvkVo" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="turing" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/team/turing/pen/ZOvkVo/">Event Bubbling Example</a> by Turing School of Software and Design (<a href="http://codepen.io/turing">@turing</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

### Pair Practice

Visit the [this page][codepen] and fork the CodePen.

* Add a click event to the button, that logs the element that was clicked on using `this`.
* Move the event listener to the `.parent` element. What is the result when you click on the button?
* Move the event listener from the first step to the `.grandparent` element.
  * What is the result when you click on the button?
  * What is is the result when you click the `.parent` element?

### Discussion

You may have noticed that the event listeners on a parent element are fired whenever the action occurs on one of its children.

When an event occurs, the browser checks the element to see if there are any event listeners registered. After it checks the element where the event occurred, the browser works its way up the DOM tree to see if any of the parents have a listener registered, then grandparents, and so on. It checks every element all the way up to the root. This process is known as _event bubbling_.

Try out the following code in the example code pen:

```js
  document.querySelector('.grandparent').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
    console.log('Grandparent');
  });

  document.querySelector('.parent').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
    console.log('Parent');
  });

  document.querySelector('#click-me').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
    console.log('Button');
  });
```

If you click on the button, you'll see that the events all bubble up through the `.parent` and `.grandparent` elements — this provides a more explicit proof than the solutions you may come up with for the previous question.

### The Event Object

The anonymous function passed to `document.addEventListener()` takes an optional argument, which it assigns an `Event` object to. In the case of the click event we've been using as an example, this is a `MouseEvent`. You can visit [the MDN page for `Event`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event) to explore the full list of supported event types.

Each type of event supports a number of different properties. `MouseEvent`s contain information about the `x` and `y` coordinates where the mouse was clicked. `KeyboardEvent` has information about which key was pressed. The `currentTarget` property on the `Event` object can be useful during the event bubbling phase.

Let's make some changes to the code from earlier. Instead of logging a description of each element where an event was triggered, either by a click or through event bubbling, let's log the `target` of the event.

```js
document.querySelector('.grandparent').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.target);
});

document.querySelector('.parent').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.target);
});

document.querySelector('#click-me').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.target);
});
```


### Pair Practice

Modify the code above to log the event itself (as opposed to the `target` property on the event). What other properties on the event object look particularly useful?

## Adding and Removing Event Listeners

A common obstacle that many JavaScript developers struggle with is understanding the timing in which they bind event listeners to DOM nodes. When we add event listeners to DOM nodes, we're only adding them to the nodes that are currently on the page. We are _not_ adding listeners to nodes that may be added to the page in the future.

### Experiment

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="23788" data-slug-hash="OXzGGR" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="turing" data-embed-version="2" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/team/turing/pen/OXzGGR/">Events: Adding a New Event Listener</a> by Turing School of Software and Design (<a href="http://codepen.io/turing">@turing</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

You should see three buttons labeled "Click me!" as well as a button for adding new buttons to the page.

1. Click each of the "Click me!" buttons and verify that each one fires an `alert` notifying you that the button has in fact been clicked.
2. Add an additional button using the "Add a new button below." button.
3. Click on your new button and observe the results.

What did you notice?

The event listeners are only bound to the buttons that were present when the page code was first loaded. The buttons we added later were not around when we added the listeners.

### Pair Practice

Can you modify the function that adds new buttons so that it adds an event listener to the element before appending it to the page?

## Event Delegation

Setting event listeners on specific newly created DOM nodes is one way to set event listeners. However, if you're not careful, you may end up setting multiple listeners on the same node.

Also, You can cause a [memory leak](http://javascript.crockford.com/memory/leak.html) if an event listeners are not unbound from an element when it is removed from the DOM. See also, [memory management and garbage collection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management), and [4 Types of Memory Leaks in Javascript and How to Get Rid of Them](https://auth0.com/blog/four-types-of-leaks-in-your-javascript-code-and-how-to-get-rid-of-them/).

Rather than manage the addition and removal of event listeners, there is a methodology you can use called ***event delegation***.

In ***event delegation***, we take advantage of the fact that events bubble in the event loops by setting an event listener on one parent. This event listener analyzes bubbled events to find a match in its child elements.

### Pair Practice

- jQuery has an easy way to do event delegation with the 'on' function. For the piano example above and see if you can do the same thing with [jQuery](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/).
