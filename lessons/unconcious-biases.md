## Reflection
Ask yourself the following:
+ Do you feel surprised, disappointed, or satisfied by your IAT results? Why?
+ Think about your own ADRESSING group memberships.  How do you think your memberships affect your results?
+ What experiences have you had that may have contributed to your results?
+ Think about your friends and family. Do you think their results would be similar to or different from yours? Why?
+ Did this activity affect your understanding of oppressed groups in society? How?
+ What might be some consequences of treating individuals or entire groups negatively based on their social group membership?
+ What do you think of this statement? “Diversity Is Being Invited to the Party; Inclusion Is Being Asked to Dance” What can you do to be more inclusive of others?
