## What does it mean to unit test your code?

We're always testing our code. We pull it up in the browser and poke at it. Does it do the thing we were expecting it to do? Yes? Then the code works. It's time to go and celebrate. No? Well then, back to the drawing board, right?

For small code bases, this works. Write or change some code and then flip over to the brower and check to see if you got the desired result. The problem is that this doesn't scale very will. When our applications start getting big, we end up with more and more places to poke.

Even worse: we can end up in a situation where changing code in one place causes something to break somewhere else—somewhere that we're not currently poking.

Constantly poking at our code is tedious and it's not the best use of our time. We're better off writing some code that tests our other code for us. This sounds almost like a joke about programmers, but it's actually a really efficient way to maintain quality in our code base.

## What are some of the different kinds of tests?

We test our code at a number of different levels:

- Unit tests test one function or one object in isolation to make sure that it behaves the way we were expecting it to.
- Integration tests test the interaction between two units to make sure that they play together nicely and work the way we expect them to.
- Acceptance tests act like a user and visit the page. When I put in a bogus zip code, do I get the error on the page that I'm expecting? Acceptance tests don't typically care about what's happening under the hood. They just care that we got the desired result. Everything could be a total mess in the code base.
- End-to-end tests test every component of the system. Let's say you have a back-end application and a front-end application. Your end-to-end tests would test both and make sure they are working together as expected.

Today, we're just talking about _unit_ tests.

## Your First Test

Let's say we were writing a function that squared a number and we wanted to write a unit test to see if it worked.

Let's talk a little bit about what's going on here:

1. We wrote our code. Typically, our test files are separate from our actual code.
2. We have a `describe()` block with denotes that we're going to start writing a number of tests about the same unit.
3. We make a statement out our code with the `it()` block.
4. We write an _assertion_ about our code. Here, we're asserting that when we pass the number 2 into `square()` that the result should be 4.

Finally, we run the tests to see if they work.

## What is test-driven development?

Test-driven development (TDD) is one of those things that is deceptively simple to explain and incredibly hard to do. The basic premise is that we write our test first and then we write our implementation. We make an assertion about how the code should work and then we go ahead and make that assertion pass.

If you think about it, this is not too far off from how you're already thinking about code. You have some idea of what you want to happen and then you go ahead and make it happen—with some amount of cursing and flailing around wildly in the middle.

With TDD, we're basically just putting that process down into writing. One of the advantages of TDD is that if you're diligent and stay on the path, then almost all of your code will be covered by tests and you can rest better at night. If a change to one part of your code base breaks some other part of your code base, then you'll know it immediately and be able to fix it quickly.

## What happens if you don't test first?

"I'll write tests later. I just want to get this working first," is one of the greatest lies in software development and it's usually one that we tell ourselves.

Beyond the issue of general motivation—let's face it, you're never going to go back and add those tests—there is the issue that not all code is testable. We won't run into this issue today, but we will soon. The thing I'd like you to keep in mind is that if you write your tests first, it's really hard to find yourself in this situation.

**Steve's Law of Testing**: If something is hard to test, it's probably not your test's fault.

## Let's practice

Enough talking about testing. Let's actually write some tests to see this in action. We'll do some together and then you'll do some on your own.
