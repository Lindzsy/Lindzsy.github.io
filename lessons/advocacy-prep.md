# Advocacy

## Learning Goals
+ To brainstorm ways to self-advocate and advocate for others.

## Reading
+ [NPR: More Than A Pipeline Problem: In Search Of Diversity In Silicon Valley](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/07/26/426364306/more-than-a-pipeline-problem-in-search-of-diversity-in-silicon-valley)
+ [Interrupting the Cycle of Oppression: The Role of Allies as Agents of Change](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/sites/default/files/diversity/docs/interpretting_oppression.pdf)
+ [Equality vs Equity](http://lachsdressur.de/wp-content/uploads/Equality-Equity.jpg)

## Think
Answer these questions to yourself:
+ How will I self-advocate for equity?
+ How will I advocate for others?
+ How do I feel about the realities of entering an industry as a minority?

## SLACK CRYSTAL
+ Your thoughts on last week’s discussion: areas you’d like more clarity, things you wish people understood, things you’d like to see action on, etc. Please be open and honest. You should slack me something.
+ Also, if you have one to share: a specific strategy you have used to cope/handle/address any of the issues we discussed in class (or related).
